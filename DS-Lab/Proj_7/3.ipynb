    "In our experiment, we're looking for a signal indicating that applicants who receive an email are more likely to complete the admissions quiz. If signal's strong, it'll be easy to see. A much higher number of applicants in our treatment group will complete the quiz. But if the signal's weak and there's only a tiny change in quiz completion, it will be harder to determine if this is a meaningful difference or just random variation. How can we separate signal from noise in this case? The answer is statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what statistical power is, let's imagine that we're radio engineers building an antenna. The size of our antenna would depend on the type of signal we wanted to detect. It would be OK to build a low-power antenna if we only wanted to detect strong signals, like a car antenna that picks up your favorite local music station. But our antenna wouldn't pick up weaker signals — like a radio station on the other side of the globe. For weaker signals, we'd need something with higher power. In statistics, power comes from the number of observations you include in your experiment. In other words, the more people we include, the stronger our antenna, and the better we can detect weak signals.\n",

    "The important part of that result is the p-value. We set our threshold for significance at 0.05 way back at the beginning, so, for our results to be statistically significant, the p-value needs to be less than or equal to 0.05. Our p-value is much higher than 0.05, which means that the difference we saw in our side-by-side bar graph is probably due to chance. In other words, it's noise, not signal. So we can't reject our null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this result mean? It means there may not be any difference between the groups, or that the difference is so small that we don't have the statistical power to detect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a simulated experiment, we can actually increase the power by re-running the experiment for a longer time. If we ran the experiment for 60 days, we might end up with a statistically-significant result. Try it and see what happens!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are two important things to keep in mind. First, just because a result is statistically significant doesn't mean that it's practically significant. A 1% increase in quiz completion may not be worth the time or resources needed to run an email campaign every day. Second, when the number of observations gets very large, any small difference is going to appear statistically significant. This increases the risk of a false positive — rejecting our null hypothesis when it's actually true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the issue of significance aside for now, there's one more calculation that can be helpful in sharing the results of an experiment: the odds ratio. In other words, how much more likely is someone in the treatment group to complete the quiz versus someone in the control group?"
